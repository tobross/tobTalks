Enclosed is a project experimenting with PHP, Database communication, and SASS.

#The Goal

To create an aesthetically pleasing example that includes a php application that communicates with a database.
Must include:
1: A database
2: PHP
3: SASS
4: Be aesthetically pleasing

I chose to create a dynamically populated seating chart.

It will pull from an already populated database and create one seat per row of data received, ultimately populating a 9x9 grid.

#The Result:

Realizing that a seating chart that is color coded to make sense for online booking would not be pleasing to the eye, and without a direction for -what- the event would be, I settled on the idea of creating a couple of pages ahead of the seating chart to ensure it at least made sense.

To that end, I created TOB Talks, a demotivational site made with bootstrap, SASS, and proprietary styling. After working their way through the site, which is only 2 pages, they will have chosen one of four events that all lead to my seating chart.

Once here, the user can select an unoccupied seat to book, or select their seat and. cancel their reservation. Future iterations will have the ability to acctually make a mock booking and that information be pulled to the database as well, but for now it is data-light.

Enjoy perusing my project!
